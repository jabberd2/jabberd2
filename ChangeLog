	* Installing Windows native service wrapper over main functions: JABBER_MAIN, this will define normal "main" on other platforms.
	* mio_new(1024) changed to mio_new(MIO_MAXFD).

	* * on Windows headers don't reside at sasl/

	* Add JABBERD2_API implementation for "sx", required to build proper jabberd2.dll on Windows.
	* mio fixed for Windows platform:
	  * select requires 3rd exception parameter
	  * lowfd added for select, because Winsock doesn't start from 1 with descriptors
	* Services shall use MIO_MAXFD instead of 1024 when calling mio_new, so we are not capped to 1024 on Windows select, since descriptors usually start above.

	* Adding DLLEXPORT to some modules so they build proper DLL on Windows. authreg_sqlite was not ANSI C complaint (declarations first), MSVC is more strict than GCC.
	* New auth modules only for Windows platform:
	  * ntlogon - plain-text, Windows NT or higher LogonUserA function authorizes only users that exist on server machine
	  * sspi - works like ntlogon, but is using sspi interface (experimental)

	* Remove incorrect semicolumn from os_object_free() in sm/object.c Typographical error in code - could lead to memory not being freed correctly - jedi
	* Fixes to mysql storage for boundary conditions	Apply if using mysql storage. -jedi
	* Fix length-related issues in base64 decoding routines. Could affect authentication in c2s. - Christof Meerwald
	* Fixes to storage_db.c to avoid roster corruption: "sm/storage_db inserts items in the filter hash table with keys which are located on the stack. This creates confusion when the code later tries to compare with these keys.". - Martin Forssen 
	* Fixes bug in _nad_escape() where escaping ]]> can cause a segfault when handling large messages where nad_realloc is called.  - Stephen Marquard
	* Fixes to pgsql storage for boundary conditions and incorrect buffer length calculation - jedi

	* Resolves problems with strings starting "NAD" being interpreted as xml in mysql/postgresql storage 	Does not require any db changes to implement. -  Stephen Marquard
	* Updates to etc/c2s.xml.dist.in and etc/s2s.xml.dist.in for c2s certificate chains and s2s ssl connections (patches #25b and #17). - Stephen Marquard
	* Corrects pipe_authreg to correctly base64-encode passwords for SET-PASSWORD and CHECK-PASSWORD calls. Apply if using pipe authentication. Note that this will change the previous (incorrect) behaviour for SET-PASSWORD and CHECK-PASSWORD which was to pass the password unencoded. - Stephen Marquard (from dgbbk)
	* Correctly free storage instance before c2s exit in cases where storage driver fails to initialise - Cameron Moore
