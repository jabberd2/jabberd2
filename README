     http://www.openssl.org/news/
 - Berkeley DB (4.1.24 or higher)

 - MySQL (development libraries and headers)
     http://www.mysql.com/
 - PAM
     http://www.linux-pam.org/  (for Linux)


Build:

  % ./configure
  % make
  % make install

Options to ./configure:

  --prefix=/path/to/install
      Where to install everything

  --enable-idn (default: enabled)
      Compile with IDN (Stringprep) support

  --enable-ssl (default: enabled)
      Compile with SSL/TLS support

  --enable-mysql (default: enabled)
      Compile MySQL auth/reg/storage support

  --enable-pgsql (default: disabled)
      Compile PostgreSQL auth/reg/storage support

  --enable-db (default: disabled)
      Compile Berkeley DB auth/reg/storage support

  --enable-ldap (default: disabled)
      Compile OpenLDAP auth/reg support

  --enable-pam (default: disabled)
      Compile PAM auth/reg support

  --enable-pipe (default: disabled)
      Compile pipe auth/reg support

  --enable-anon (default: disabled)
      Compile anonymous auth support

  --enable-fs (default: disabled)
      Compile filesystem storage support (NOT RECOMMENDED)

  --enable-mio=BACKEND
      Specify MIO backend to use (poll or select)

  --with-extra-include-path
  --with-extra-library-path
      Add extra header/library search paths
      
  --enable-debug (default: disabled)
      Output debugging info when run with -D

  --enable-nad-debug (default: disabled)
      Compile with NAD pointer tracking

  --enable-pool-debug (default: disabled)
      Compile with pool statistics

  --enable-developer (default: disabled)
      Compile with full warnings and debugging symbols


Configure:

  Edit $prefix/etc/(router|sm|c2s|resolver|s2s).xml to taste. In
  particular, make sure you setup for your choice of data storage
  correctly. If you're using the Berkeley DB backend, you'll need to
  create /var/run/jabberd and sets its permissions so that the server
  processes can find it.
  
  If you're using a SQL backend, you'll need to create an account for
  the server to use, and create the tables. Load db-setup.mysql or
  db-setup.pgsql from the tools/ directory into your database to do
  this.

  If you plan to use the jabberd wrapper script, make sure you look at
  the paths in the $prefix/etc/jabber/jabberd.cfg.


Run:

  You can either run all of the pieces separately:

    % $prefix/bin/router &
    % $prefix/bin/resolver &
    % $prefix/bin/s2s &
    % $prefix/bin/sm &
    % $prefix/bin/c2s &

  Or you can run them all from the jabberd wrapper script:

    % $prefix/jabberd &

All the processes can take the following switches:

    -c use an alternate config file
    -D output lots of debugging info (if compiled with --enable-debug)

When requesting assistance, please note that the following things can
provide useful information which may assist with finding your problem:

 - debug logs (compile with --enable-debug and run with -D)
 - running components seperately (ie without the wrapper script)
 - config.log

Please try to provide as much relevant information as possible when
reporting problems - it will make helping you much easier.
